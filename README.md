## About

Hi, i'm James! I am a seasoned data analyst with a strong background in MI reporting, data analysis, and data visualisation. I started this site to showcase my experience with data analysis and visualisation using Tableau, SQL & Excel.  

In April 2024 I obtained my [Tableau Data Analyst Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/56065f86-bdd9-4863-a18e-eeb7be74cf17/public_url) ; this followed from me obtaining my [Tableau Desktop Specialist Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/98053c2c-3344-449c-a48c-f7127e5c20cf/public_url) in June 2023.
