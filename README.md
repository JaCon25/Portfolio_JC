# James Conrad - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi, i'm James! I am a seasoned data analyst with a strong background in MI reporting, data analysis, and data visualisation. I started this site to showcase my experience with data analysis and visualisation using Tableau, SQL & Excel.  

In April 2024 I obtained my [Tableau Data Analyst Certification](https://jacon25.github.io/Portfolio_JC/assets/images/Cert_Data-Analyst.png) ; this followed from me obtaining my [Tableau Desktop Specialist Certification](https://jacon25.github.io/Portfolio_JC/assets/images/cert_Tableau_Specialist.png) in June 2023.
